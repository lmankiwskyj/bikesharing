Module 14

## Overview 
During a recent trip to New York City (NYC), I was amazed at how easy and fun it was to use their bike sharing program.  This was the inspiration to start a similar program back home in Des Moines.  Using data from NYC's bike share program, Citibike, we were able to create a set of visualizations to show how we can model the same program in Iowa.

## Results
Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis 
There is a description of the results for each visualization

  - the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
  - the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
  - the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
