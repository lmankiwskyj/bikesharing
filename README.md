## Overview 
During a recent trip to New York City (NYC), my best friend and I were amazed at how easy and fun it was to use their bike sharing program.  This was our inspiration to start a similar program back home in Des Moines.  Using data from NYC's bike share program, Citibike, we were able to create a set of visualizations to show just how we can model the same program in Iowa.
